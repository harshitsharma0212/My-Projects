# üõ†Ô∏è Information Gathering Tool

A simple Python-based information gathering tool that fetches the **IP address** and **location** details of any given website using public APIs.

## üìå Objective

The main objective of this project was to create a tool that demonstrates **basic reconnaissance techniques** in the initial phase of cybersecurity. This includes:

- Resolving domain names to IP addresses
- Fetching geolocation and ISP data using a public API
- Parsing and displaying JSON data in a clean format

## üß∞ Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `socket`
  - `sys`
  - `request`
  - `json`
- **API Used**: [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/)
- **Operating System**: Kali Linux

## üöÄ How the Tool Works

1. User enters the website name via command line:
   ```bash
   python infotool.py <website_url>

   2.The script:

Resolves the IP address using socket.gethostbyname()

Sends the IP to the ipinfo.io API

Fetches location details in JSON

Prints the output using json.dumps() in readable format




üñ•Ô∏è Installation & Usage
